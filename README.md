## Data preparation
In the initial preparation, i
- imported/loaded the data
- data inspection/ handling missing values 
- data cleaning / Removing duplicates
  
 _**PREPARING THE DATA FOR PIVOT CREATION**_
  
- After ensuring that the data was cleaned up nicely, i went ahead to make sure that daatypes matched and thats where i encountered my first problem
The more than half of the data in the dates in the data wasnt recogniced as a date function  by excel, i tried to make it recognize it, first i tried using the number column in the sales region and this proved abortive, i also tried using text to columns and that didnt work either, finally after an eternity of watching different youtube videos, i used the locale function in excel power query to make the date column to be regconized as date.
- When this was sorted out, i created a new column using the order and shipping date to get the total processing time for each order that was placed called Processing time
- i used the text() fuynction to extract the month and year of each transaction as different columns
- i used the formular =IF(X2=0,"NO Discount",IF(X2<0.2,"Low Discount","High Discount")) to create a new column called discount level from the DISCOUNT column and were we ready for our pivot creation.
  
- pivot table creation
- visualization

## CONCUDION AND RECOMMENDATION
### CONCLUSION
In my analysis of the sales dataset,
- i observed clear seasonal trends, with sales peaking in the first quarter of the year.
- Customer demographics played a significant role, as our younger customer segment exhibited higher purchase frequency
- Additionally, the 'High Discount' offer category displayed a strong positive correlation with decreased sales leading to Significant **LOSS**, Highlighting the importance of LOWER discounting OR NO DISCOUNT at all.
-  Overall, these insights will guide our sales strategy to maximize revenue and meet customer demands effectively."

## RECOMMENDATION
1. The Discount offer should be scrapped or reduced to the barest mininum as high discount is associated with low sales and **LOSS** in business funds.
2. Even tho negligible since it has no direct adverse effect on sales, More effective meathods should be utilized to hesten order processing time while maintaining quality of services  and customer relationship.
3. Enhance customer engagement strategies, including personalized offers, loyalty programs, and improved customer service, to further boost sales and cultivate customer loyalty.
4. Given the observed seasonal trends, consider allocating resources and marketing efforts to target the peak sales periods effectively. Special promotions and product launches can be planned to maximize revenue during these times.
5. More and efficient process should be adopted for better data collection.
